Connect Four game built with JQuery

Connect Four is a two-player board connection game in which each player has a unique color-id. The players take turns dropping their unique colored disc from the top into a seven-column six-row vertically suspended grid. Every dropping piece falls from the top to the bottom until the lowest available space is met.

The first player to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of four in a row same colored discs wins the game.

The game is solved with a knowledge-based approach. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
